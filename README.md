# Information
This plugin adds a Stackable Spawner System to PMMP. When you place a Spawner, you can stack additional Spawners onto the same Spawner to increase it's spawn rate. This lets you conserve space and also prevents lag due to a large amount of Spawners.  
For example: A single Zombie Spawner spawns one Zombie every 40 seconds. Stacking another Zombie Spawner on it changes the spawn rate to 20 seconds.
